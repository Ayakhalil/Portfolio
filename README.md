# Aya's Portfolio
I created this webpage to achieve UI/UX Design course requirements.
This project has 4 HTML pages you can navigate in, index "Home page", About me, work and projects and I tried to create a well balanced design that gives a look & feel of my personality. 
Each HTML page describes a part of my "Lebenslauf" with advanced features:
- Responsive grid
- Landing page / header / footer / navigation bar
- Several sections with well structured content
- Working with at least on component from a css-library like a carousel
- Image gallery 
* in the index.html file, this is the main page where you can get to know about me a little bit with designed button to direct you down to the contact me section, in the footer icons with link that will derict you to my linkedin, github, email me or call me, the footer and the contact me form is applied to all html files as well.
* in the aboutMe.html file, you can find more about my skills and what languages I speak and what hard skills I have.
* in the work.html file, you will find the past working experience I had through my studies as an intern.
* in the project.html file you will find the past projects that I have worked on, I created the carousel there in order to show my project pictures, but due to confidential reasons the water company did not agree to post pictures, even if I removed the confidential data or sensoring it. instead I put a random gallery of my hobbies. 
you can take a look at the citation and reference pdf for more information about the cited content and links.
